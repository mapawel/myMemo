# myMemo - shadowDOM, webComponents modern TODO app

> :warning: One of my very early projects completed during my front-end and basic JavaScript learning. Since that time, I have gained a lot of skills, and today it would look completely different :see_no_evil: I leave the code in the repository as a trace of my learning process from 2020 for comparison with current projects.

### Description:
Even though the application was written by me at a fairly early stage of learning JavaScript, I still find it very interesting even after years, and it's worth taking a closer look at!

The application implements shadowDOM and WebComponents, which are rarely used approaches in JavaScript. You have probably seen hundreds of similar TODO lists written in various programming languages. How many of them were based on shadowDOM?

It's a combination of the world of frameworks with VanillaJS - still pure JavaScript, but dynamically rendering HTML using JavaScript. It also incorporates elements of OOP and modularity.
